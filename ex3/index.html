      <p class="bio">Hi! My name is Frankie! I'm an 8 year old King Charles Cavalier Spaniel.
        I've lived in Lawrence my whole life, but I've moved house 4 times! The last time we
        moved, I got a sister named Ella, she's a black Labrador mix. She's okay most of the time
        but sometimes she really gets on my nerves. As of last week, I have 7 teeth, which is why my tongue always
        hangs out. I used to have all of them, but my mom says I have bad gums so every time I go to see
        Miranda (that's my doctor), they take out about 7 of them so I'm starting to run low. In my free time I
        love to eat and sleep on my mom's lap. I also love walks, but only if I get lots of treats!</p>
